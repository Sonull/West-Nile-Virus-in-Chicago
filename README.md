# Objective of the Analysis
Predicting the likelihood of West Nile Virus being present given the location and time of the spray, weather conditions as well as the species of the mosquito present in Chicago.

# Background
On average, around 20% of people who become infected with the West Nile virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death. In 2002, the first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in Chicago. By 2004, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.
Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitoes in traps across the city of Chicago are tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.

# Project Scope and Goal
In this project, we plan to analyze how we can prevent or West Nile Virus outbreak. Currently, our datasets mainly include information within the city of Chicago in terms of the number of mosquito traps, weather conditions, mosquito spraying, and mosquito species. Most of the data provide all the above information by specific latitude and longitude as well as include information of day and time.
Given the weather, location, mosquito, and spraying data, we are going to predict the presence of the West Nile Virus at a specific location, date, time and weather conditions. With this project, we hope to help the City of Chicago more efficiently and effectively allocate resources to prevent the outbreak of the West Nile Virus.
